stands eligantly in the window mimicking a meowth
enjoys her cup of coffee
purrs loudly then flops on the floor
watches %s intensly not sure if to be mortified or aroused
puts her butt in the air invitingly
looks at you judgementally
starts chewing up a box to block out the noise
bats at the sticky goo dangling from the wall
scurrys across the keyboard.... again
mistakes the last of %s's weed for catnip and eats it all
scratches her claws on %s's urine marked fursuit
gets her paw stuck to %s's sock. Gross!
lays in %s's lap, effectivly being a cockblock
