makes mewing sounds
meows
softly rumbles with purring sounds
lays on the ground
grooms herself
plays with a ball of yarn
rolls on the floor
chases butterflies
demands to be petted
cries for food
licks chops
yawns and lays down
chases her tail
plays with random lint ball
runs around
licks paws
wants to play
whips tail around
rubs her face against the door
looks back and forth at the wall for hours
rabbit foots herself in the face
rubs against the floor
runs in circles
flops around on the floor wanting to be pet
wishes there was more time to sleep in the day
wants to live in a world of fish
gets underneath everyones feet
scratches the furniture up
meows incessantly
playfully attacks long grass
waves tail around
knocks over things on the counters
sheds everywhere
runs in circles then into the wall
rolls into a bowl of food
meows for hours for no reason
wants to make new friends today
wishes there were more people to play with
wants there to be fish forever
wishes she never had to stop sleeping
lays in the sun
gets high on catnip
wants more catnip
is addicted to catnip
crawls under the couch
bites Luna
looks for a lap to cuddle in
catches a fly in midair
catches a mouse and growls at everyone nearby
chirps at a bug
goes fishing
pretends to be innocent
attacks a roll of toilet paper and runs around the house
gets her face stuck in a bowl
rolls in a pile of dirt
suckles on a fluffy blanket
stares out the window for hours
plays with water in her dish
prepares to pounce
climbs into a box and waits
