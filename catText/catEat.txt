hungrily chews the food
sniffs the food and meows
licks the food
chews the food some before spitting it out
eats like a Queen
loves food
doesnt even know this food is bad and loves it
wishes there was more fancy feast
stares at the food and meows at it
flips the bowl of food over and meows for more
slowly eats the meal a little at a time
hungrily chomps the meal down
meows because she can see the bottom of the bowl
begs for bacon
bites the hand that fed her
poops in her dish and blames the dog
noisily stuffs her face
sniffs the food and gags
